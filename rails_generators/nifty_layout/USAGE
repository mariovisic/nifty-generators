Description:
  The nifty_layout generator creates a basic layout, stylesheet and
  helper which will give some structure to a starting Rails app.
  
  The generate uses haml and sass for the layout and stylesheet, so
  you will have to include the haml gem in your project to operate
  correctly.
  
  The generator takes one argument which will be the name of the
	layout and stylesheet files. If no argument is passed then it defaults
	to "application".
  
  The helper module includes some methods which can be called in any
  template or partial to set variables to be used in the layout, such as
  page title and javascript/stylesheet includes.

Examples:
    script/generate nifty_layout

        Layout:     app/views/layouts/application.html.haml
        Stylesheet: public/stylesheets/sass/application.sass
        Helper:     app/helpers/layout_helper.rb


    script/generate nifty_layout admin

        Layout:     app/views/layouts/admin.html.haml
        Stylesheet: public/stylesheets/sass/admin.sass
        Helper:     app/helpers/layout_helper.rb
